This template has got Next-Lint, Prettier, and Husky set up to consistently write and style your code.  
This template is for a React-Next.js-Typescript, but you can modify it as you like.  
I use Visual Studio code and installed the ESLint and Prettier extentions.  
Your code will auto-format whenever you hit save and pre-commit hooks to check your code for style consistency using Husky.  
It uses the Google's Typescript style guidelines.

Simply git clone and `npm install` at the root,  
Install the ESLint and ES7 vscode extensions,  
write some code,

```
git add .
git commit -m <message>
```

The terminal will let you know if you need to fix anything in your code, otherwise it accepts the commit.

See the notes.txt for more details of the set up.
