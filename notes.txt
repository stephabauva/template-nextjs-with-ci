add settings lines to .eslintrc.js

npm install --save-dev prettier  
npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier

add 'prettier' to 'extends' of .eslintrc.js

install vscode extensions ES7 and Prettier
in settings:

- "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
- "editor.formatOnPaste": true
- "editor.formatOnSave": true,

```
import React from "react";

/**
 * Home Page of the Application
 * @return {JSX.Element}
 */
export default function Home(): JSX.Element {
```

prettier --write .
zsh: command not found: prettier
Fix: npm install -g prettier

To execute eslint and prettier everytime you save:
add .vscode folder in root
add settings.json file in .vscode
In this file, you can add settings specific to a particular project.  
At the end of settings.josn, we say that eslint format first and then prettier format.

Install husky to set up a pre git commit hook that is going to do 4 things:

- no prettier warnings in the code
- no eslint warnings in the code
- no errors compiling typesript
- that we can run a valid build using Next build

npx husky-init
npm install

In package.json, in scripts:
"check-types": "tsc --pretty --noEmit", //check typescript with prettier  
"check-format": "prettier --check .", //tells prettier to check all files, except the ones added to a .prettierignore file  
"check-lint": "eslint . --ext ts ext tsx --ext js", //tells eslint to check all .ts, .tsx and .tsx files
"format":.. //automatically rewrite all of our files with proper formatting
"test-all":.. // runs some of the above commands in sequence

Update: Next.JS 11 now includes built-in support for ESLint -> add "next-lint": "next lint" to package.json.
then do `npm run next-lint` in your terminal. You can also add it to the check sequence in your .husky/pre-commit file.

add pre-commit file in .husky file that will run all scripts before it is commited and log warnings and errors.

Notes:

- I commented the npm run build part of pre-commit, uncomment if you want to add that stage.
- added:

```
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */
/* eslint-disable require-jsdoc */
/* eslint-disable react/react-in-jsx-scope */
```

to \_app.js.

- add lint-staged to check staged files
- added .eslintignore and .prettierignore with a few extentions to ignore

Notes for github actions:
An action is a reusable unit of code;  
A matrix allows you to create multiple jobs by performing variable substitution in a single job definition.   
For example, you can use a matrix to create jobs for more than one supported version of a programming language,   
operating system, or tool.   
--> you put your variables in "strategy", for e.g. os: [ubuntu-latest], and then get the variable by doing {{ matrix.os }}.
